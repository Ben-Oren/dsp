CRAFTING FILES
“#!/bin/bash” is in the first line of a bash script; it indicates what program executes the code; in this case, bash.  Called a Shebang.  Spacing is important, needs to be in first cursor spot


“./example.sh” ./ indicates current directory/path position


VARIABLES

referring to / reading variable = use a $

setting variable, don’t use $, no space w/ = sign; variable=value

single quotes treats every characther literally; double quotes allows variable calls inside of variables
	
	ex 	myvar = 7
		echo ‘$myvar is a hard age’ -> $myvar is a hard age
		echo “$myvar is a hard age” -> 7 is a hard age

can store the output of a command inside a variable

	ex 	myvar=$( ls /etc | wc -l )
